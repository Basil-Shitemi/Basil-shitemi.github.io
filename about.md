## Welcome to my Portfolio
- I am a qualified medical doctor (MBChB) currently in practice, with a growing passion for artificial intelligence and machine learning. As someone who has witnessed firsthand the challenges in healthcare, I believe that integrating technology—especially AI—can revolutionize the way we deliver care, improve patient outcomes, and address global health challenges.

- With the rapid advancements in AI and its potential to transform industries, I am keen on exploring how these technologies can be applied within the health sector. From enhancing diagnostics to predictive analytics, personalized medicine, and healthcare management, I aim to leverage AI to develop innovative, real-world solutions that bridge the gap between technology and clinical practice.

- I am currently deepening my understanding of AI and data science through self-study, practical projects, and interdisciplinary collaborations. My long-term goal is to combine my medical expertise with AI to create impactful solutions that empower healthcare professionals and improve patient care on a larger scale.

- Beyond my professional pursuits, I am equally dedicated to fitness and wellness, recognizing the profound connection between physical health and overall quality of life. I aim to inspire others to embrace a balanced lifestyle, blending scientific insights with personal empowerment.
